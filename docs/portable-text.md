# Portable text appearance

Text remains editable characters and styled ranges. A machine with the named font faces also
saves positioned glyph outlines, decorations, line metrics and the text box in `TextData.appearance`.
A fingerprint covers the text and its layout settings, so geometry from an older edit is never
used for different characters or typography. No font file is embedded, installed or distributed.

Opening, saving, publishing and locally editing text capture appearances where the original
faces exist. `text.preserveAppearance {}` captures existing layers too, including a document that
was published before this feature. Run it on a machine with the original fonts. A collaborator
cannot recover the original appearance from a substitute font; missing faces are never captured
as if they were the originals. The command reports the number captured.

On a machine without the faces, valid saved outlines draw on the canvas and in SVG/PDF exports.
Its text boxes are not auto-sized in a substitute font. Moving layers preserves their geometry.
Editing preserved text or its typography requires installing the missing faces or explicitly
replacing them with installed ones. The Missing fonts window also checks joined server tabs.
Documents without saved geometry retain the previous fallback display; the warning says that
saved outlines apply where available. This does not repair a file whose text was already replaced.

The existing node-kind change carries appearances through snapshots, updates, server persistence,
undo and redo. Update participating clients and the server together: older versions understand
the editable text but may discard the optional appearance. Native `.figcraft` saves retain it;
the experimental `.fig` exporter does not currently write this extension.

Limits: 100,000 glyphs and 16 MiB of outline strings per layer. Colour bitmap/COLR glyphs currently
skip capture rather than silently losing their colour. Outlines preserve display, not font-based
editing. Font substitutions and missing styles still need the original fonts or an explicit
replacement. Different installed versions of the same named face are not detected.

Validation: `crates/engine/tests/portable_text.rs` starts a separate process without system fonts.
It verifies identical rendered pixels and outlined SVG, PDF export, native save/reopen, protected
text editing and moving a layer. The synthetic face exists only in the author's process; neither
its font bytes nor private artwork are stored in test fixtures.
